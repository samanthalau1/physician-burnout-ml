# Detecting Physician Burnout (ML Project)

The goal of this study is to analyze the application of machine learning techniques in the context of predicting physician burnout. As research shows, burnout can be quantified and therefore is applicable as a data set in machine learning. Machine learning has been found to usually be a more accurate predictor than humans, as humans require expensive computation methods and can be swayed by their own opinions.
